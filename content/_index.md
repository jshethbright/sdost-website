## We specialize in music from video games and anime!

Formed in September 2023, Orchestral Soundtracks (OST) is a San Diego community orchestra for members to arrange and perform music from their favorite soundtracks. A group of musicians who came together through their college orchestra decided they wanted to continue playing, arranging, and conducting, so they formed OST to provide that opportunity to everyone. OST aims to bring to life the artistic expression and emotional depth of both soundtrack music and musicians through live performance.
